                        who are seeking to move beyond compliance towards a culture of continuous
                        improvement Grounded in research on shared understanding on mathematical
                        identities and routines guiding mastery, the Blueprint Math engages learners
                        to greater focus on fewer topics linked across grades. Students participate
                        in hands-on application of conceptual understanding, practice with skills and
                        fluency and developing multiple solution paths towards mastery.
